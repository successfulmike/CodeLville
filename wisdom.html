        <p>"The Little that Beats the Market" by Joel Greenblatt is a fundamental read for anyone serious about investing for the long term.

        <p>Understanding the difference between trading and investing is also pivotal. There's absolutely nothing wrong with trading, but how CONSISTENT are your trading results? Do you have the time to be monitoring the market all day? No and no? Then you should focus your efforts on investing like a true investor - for the long term.

        <p>At MDV we highly recommend any book written by Mr. Greenblatt, he seems to know what he's talking about :-). Books by Seth Klarman are also good for digestion IF you can find them.
