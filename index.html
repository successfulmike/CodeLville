        <p>What you're doing isn't working! You're hard earned money, gone!
           You're ready to put the odds in your favor; you're ready to beat the market! Get ready for some magic, because you won't believe what's possible. You CAN invest better AND keep your profits. Time to get CONSISTENT results!

        <p id="para">Find value, focus on value. Get paid for finding value, get paid to hold value. Value investing will be here because it's real and frowned upon by the masses. Everyone, including the institutions (those who really move the markets), are focused on growth and momentum stocks. YOU focus on value. YOU have the patience to outlast the market and your peers, because value investing is the one CONSISTENT game in town. Why? Because it makes sense! Simple! Value investing detaches you from focusing on th market and places your focus where it should be - on the company you're investing in (buying a piece of).
          <br><br>
          With your attention solely affixed on the company, how it makes money, will it be around in the future, and what it does with your money are all the things you need to know to determine if you should become a partner (buy its shares) or not.
